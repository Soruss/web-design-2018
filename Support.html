	<b>RETURNS & REFUNDS<img src="Images/Support/Plus.png" class="Plus" align="right"></b> <!-- QUESTION -->
	<div id="faq7" class="FAA">
	<a> <!-- ANSWER -->
	Our Returns & Refund Policy is limited to products purchased directly from our RAY Online Store and the procedure for returns must be initiated within 14 days from the date the item was delivered. Please note that for items purchased from other retailers, we can only assist in warranty support.

In order to qualify for a full refund of the purchase price of the product (exclusive of initial shipping and handling charges), you must contact the Technical Support team to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA) within the specified time frame of the said product. The product must be returned to RAY in its original packaging and condition.

Please note that the RMA number must be noted on the outside of the returned product's package. You will be considered to have returned the said product to RAY if you have delivered the product to a carrier and have taken all necessary steps to ensure that the product is delivered to RAY, including paying all shipping charges in returning the product to RAY. We advise that you select a method of shipping that is traceable.

Risk in the returned product only passes to RAY when the product is received by RAY and RAY shall not be responsible for items lost in transit to us. You will receive a refund of the purchase price that you had paid for the returned product (excluding any charges for the initial shipping and handling of the product to you) within 45 days of RAY&#39;s receipt of the returned product. In the event that the procedure herein is not followed, RAY reserves the right to accept the return of the product on such terms that it may determine at its sole discretion.

See our warranty terms for more detailed information regarding our warranty policies.

	<b>Do I have to pay sales tax?<img src="Images/Support/Plus.png" class="Plus" align="right"></b> <!-- QUESTION -->
	<div id="faq8" class="FAA">
	<a> <!-- ANSWER -->
	Depending on the order, sales tax may be calculated and charged. Any sales tax charged will be indicated once your billing and/or shipping address have been entered during checkout.

The price indicated includes anticipated VAT that we will collect from you based on information you make available to us. The total price may change during the course of the shopping session depending on a number of factors. However, you will have the opportunity to review the final price we will charge before you submit your order. A national VAT rate will be applied on physical goods for customers based in EU countries. This VAT may not be shown as a separate charge during checkout and may instead be included in the product price (VAT inclusive pricing).
